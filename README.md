# GPT-From-Scratch-

Welcome to **GPT-From-Scratch-**!  
This project is a hands-on implementation and exploration of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), built from the ground up. The goal is to demystify the inner workings of transformer-based language models by providing readable, well-documented code and clear explanations.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Educational:** Understand the architecture and components of GPT models.
- **Practical:** Build a minimal yet functional transformer model from scratch.
- **Extensible:** Serve as a foundation for experimenting with custom features, optimizations, or modifications.

---

## 📚 Features

- Implementation of transformer blocks: Multi-head self-attention, positional encoding, and feedforward layers.
- Tokenization and data preprocessing utilities.
- Training and inference scripts.
- Comments and explanations throughout the codebase.
- Example notebooks and sample datasets for quick experimentation.

## 📖 Usage

Example: Training a small GPT model on your own text data

```bash
python train.py --config configs/small_gpt.yaml --data data/your_corpus.txt
```

Example: Generating text

```python
from gpt.model import GPT
model = GPT.load_from_checkpoint('checkpoints/best.pt')
prompt = "Once upon a time,"
output = model.generate(prompt, max_length=50)
print(output)
```
